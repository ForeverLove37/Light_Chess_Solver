# Frontend Refactor Summary

## Date: 2025-10-04

## Overview
Complete frontend refactor to resolve white screen issue and restore functionality. The refactor focused on simplifying the complex component architecture while maintaining all essential features.

## Refactor Strategy

### Phase 1: Problem Diagnosis
- Identified multiple missing variable declarations
- Found circular dependencies in components
- Discovered over-engineered performance optimizations
- Located missing component implementations

### Phase 2: Simplified Implementation
- Created minimal working components
- Implemented step-by-step feature restoration
- Established clean component architecture
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces

### Phase 3: Feature Restoration
- Re-implemented theme switching
- Added 1000fps hyper-performance mode
- Integrated challenge mode functionality
- Restored all core game features

## Files Created

### New Core Components
- `src/components/game/SimpleMatrixCell.tsx` - Basic matrix cell component
- `src/components/game/SimpleGameBoard.tsx` - Simplified game board
- `src/components/game/SimpleHyperPerformanceGameBoard.tsx` - Performance-optimized board
- `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` - Modern notification system
- `src/components/ui/SimpleThemeSwitcher.tsx` - Theme switching component
- `src/components/ui/SimpleChallengeMode.tsx` - Challenge mode interface

### New Hooks
- `src/hooks/utils/useTheme.tsx` - Theme management hook

### Documentation
- `docs/history/BUG_FIX_LOG.md` - Detailed bug fix documentation
- `docs/history/REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - This refactor summary

## Architecture Changes
